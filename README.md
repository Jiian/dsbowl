Machine Learning project - Kaggle DS Bowl 2019

This is my first Machine Learning project, first Python project and first upload to Github.
This project mainly uses FastAI library provided by Jeremy Howard.
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files - Actual.ipynb and submission.ipynb

Actual.ipynb
> full steps taken in arriving at the best Random Forest model
> shows full thought process in preliminary processing, preprocessing, training, tunning, interpreting and finalising my model
> best Validation score is 0.6267297769674376 > could not check for test score due to nature of this Kaggle competition
> there are some error cells which can be ignored >> the errors are due to incomplete re-runs of notebook

submission.ipynb
> the file submitted as a Kaggle notebook
> contains only necessary codes
> excludes reasoning, EDA and any unnecessary codes that do not directly lead to the final model
